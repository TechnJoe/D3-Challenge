          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The dynamically interactive chart above shows a US States correlations between Poverty, Age and Household income in relations to 
            lack of Healthcare, Smoking and Obesity.</p>

          <p>It is clear that the richer States have a low  obesity and smoking rates but has higher healthcare coverage levels.
            The State of MA leads with the best healthcare at only 4.65 un-insured while TX has the worst healthcare coverage at 24.9% un-insured. 
            NH has the lowest poverty level 9.2%, while MS has the highest poverty level at 21.5%.
            Obesity and smoking seems to be prevalent at the median ages of 36 - 42 years old.
            Household median income in most States are between 45k - 55k. These households has a median Obesity and Smoking rates of 24 - 32%.
            In all these visualizations, there are clear outliers in all correlations results.</p>

          <p>One interesting factor observed between all these correlations trends points to the fact that the southern states, MS, LA, AL, TN, SC, KY 
            have very high poverty and obesity levels and lack of healthcare and low household income, BUT they lead in smoking. </p>
